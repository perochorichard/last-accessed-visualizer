# Last Accessed Visualizer Plugin

## Overview

This Obsidian plugin is designed to help you maintain and organize your digital "second brain". Just as knowledge in your brain benefits from periodic access, your digital vault needs the same care. This plugin provides a visual representation of the areas in your vault that haven't been accessed recently by gradually changing color from green to red.

## Features

- Visualize the last time you accessed specific vault areas.
- Color-coded tabs in the file explorer based on the freshness of your interactions.
- Identify areas in your vault that require refreshing and revisiting.

## How it Works

1. **Installation**:
   - Install the "Last Accessed Visualizer" plugin through the Obsidian Community Plugins settings.

2. **Usage**:
   - After installation, the plugin will begin tracking your interactions with tabs in the file explorer.

3. **Color Indicators**:
   - Tabs in the file explorer change color based on the last time you spent at least 1 minute in them.
   - Green: Recently accessed.
   - Orange: Not refreshed for a moderate period.
   - Red: Long overdue for refreshing.
